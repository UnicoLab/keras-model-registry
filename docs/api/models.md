## ⏱️ Time Series Forecasting

### 🎛️ TimeMixer
TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting. 

A state-of-the-art time series forecasting model that uses decomposable components and multi-scale mixing to capture both seasonal and trend patterns at different temporal scales.

::: kerasfactory.models.TimeMixer

**Key Features:**
- Trend-seasonal decomposition (moving average or DFT)
- Multi-scale seasonal and trend mixing
- Channel-independent or dependent processing
- Support for temporal features (month, day, hour, etc.)
- Reversible instance normalization for improved training
- Multivariate time series forecasting

**Architecture:**
- Decomposition layer extracts seasonal and trend components
- Multi-scale mixing layers hierarchically combine patterns
- Encoder blocks with past decomposable mixing
- Projection layers for forecast horizon
- Reversible normalization for stable training

### 🔀 TSMixer
TSMixer: All-MLP Architecture for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.

An efficient all-MLP model that jointly learns temporal and cross-sectional representations through alternating temporal and feature mixing layers without attention mechanisms.

::: kerasfactory.models.TSMixer

**Key Features:**
- Temporal and feature mixing for dual-perspective learning
- Optional reversible instance normalization for training stability
- Configurable stacking of mixing layers (n_blocks parameter)
- Linear time complexity O(B × T × D²) vs attention O(B × T²)
- Multivariate time series forecasting support
- No attention mechanisms - simple, efficient, interpretable

**Architecture:**
- Instance normalization (optional reversible normalization)
- Stacked mixing layers (temporal + feature mixing per block)
- Output projection layer mapping seq_len → pred_len
- Reverse instance denormalization (optional)

**When to Use:**
- Large batch sizes or long sequences where efficiency matters
- Interpretability is important (no attention black box)
- Limited GPU memory - MLP-based is more memory efficient
- Multi-scale temporal and feature interactions needed
- Long-term forecasting with multiple related time series
