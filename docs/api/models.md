# Models API Reference

This page provides comprehensive documentation for all KMR models. All models are designed to work exclusively with Keras 3 and provide high-level abstractions for common tabular data processing tasks.

## Core Models

### BaseFeedForwardModel
A flexible feed-forward model that can handle individual feature inputs and provides a clean interface for tabular data processing.

## Advanced Models

### SFNEBlock
Sparse Feature Network Ensemble block for advanced feature processing and ensemble learning.

### TerminatorModel
A comprehensive model that combines multiple SFNE blocks for complex tabular data tasks.

## Base Classes

### BaseModel
Base class for all KMR models, providing common functionality and ensuring compatibility with Keras 3.
